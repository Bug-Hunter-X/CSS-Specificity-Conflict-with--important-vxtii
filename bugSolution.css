To solve this issue, refactor the CSS to avoid using `!important`. For instance, adjust the order of CSS rules or use a more specific selector to achieve the desired styling without overriding specificity with `!important`. Here's an example solution focusing on adjusting the selector's specificity to remove `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

.child {
  color: red; /* !important removed */
}
```

In this revised version, the `.parent .child` selector has higher specificity, ensuring that the green color is applied to the child element when it's a descendant of the parent element.  The `!important` declaration has been removed, making the code more maintainable and predictable.
