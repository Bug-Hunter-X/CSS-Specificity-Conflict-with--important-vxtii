# CSS Specificity Conflict with !important

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to specificity and the `!important` declaration.  The bug highlights a situation where a higher-specificity selector is unexpectedly overridden by a lower-specificity selector that uses `!important`.

## Bug Description

The issue arises from the interaction between CSS specificity and the `!important` flag.  While generally, more specific selectors override less specific ones, the `!important` declaration forces the application of a style rule regardless of specificity.

## Solution

The best way to handle such issues is to avoid using `!important` as much as possible.  Re-evaluating your CSS structure and trying to resolve style conflicts through specificity alone is often better for maintainability and predictability.

If `!important` is unavoidable, very carefully consider its implications. It's best to use it sparingly, commenting clearly on why it is necessary and what potential conflicts it might introduce.
